# Introduction 
1) A page that displays the 5 or more products (images and descriptions) that may be purchased in
various quantities. This, and/or an optional product details page, should allow the user to select
a quantity for purchase.
2) A shopping cart page that shows the selected items and quantities of each user. This page
should optionally allow the user to change quantities or remove items from the cart. This page
should also allow the user to finalize their purchase.
3) An account creation/editing page where the user can create a new account or modify current
details. This page should at least collect/update the user's shipping address. Other optional
behavior could include password change. Optionally, account creation should be at the discretion
of the user, so they may purchase anonymously.
4) A comments page where purchasers with accounts may rate and comment on products they
have purchased with their account information. They may optionally upload photos as well as
enter comment text. This page should also display comments from others to the current user
before and after the purchase.
5) A login element on every page that shows the user a login dialog for switching from anonymous
shopping. The element should optionally switch to showing the user's name when logged in.
Data will be hardcoded, as demonstrated in class, in a way that can easily be replaced by data provided
by server side APIs in subsequent assignments.
